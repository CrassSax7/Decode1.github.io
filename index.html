        <p4>Scott Pedersen is the founder of Self Defense Decode. Scott, (called Mr. P. by many students), 
            originally took Judo classes in the 5th and 6th grades. 
            In 1991 he returned to martial arts   when he began training in Kenpo Karate.  Mr. P. would go on to 
            eventually earn a 6th degree Black Belt in Kenpo.  While training in Kenpo, Mr. P. then added Modern 
            Arnis (Filipino stick fighting), got a 3rd Degree Black belt in Hock Hochheim’s Force Necessary 
            (a fantastic modern combatives system), competed in Kickboxing and captured an amateur title 
            in Mixed Martial Arts competition.  </p4>
            <br><br>
    
        <p4>Mr. P. took over the Synergy Martial Arts school, as an owner and operator, in 1999.  His dojo simultaneously offered these separate systems, but, in 2014, he set out to combine the most important parts of these different programs. He created a single system called Self Defense Decode.  The name ‘Decode’ was chosen because it demystifies questions on personal protection and combat.  Self Defense Decode is designed to intelligently take a beginning student, with no previous martial arts training, to a point of proficiency where they can successfully deal with common threats and attacks.  Thankfully, despite being built as a path of progression for beginners, it’s been extremely well received by both novices and experts alike! </p4>
